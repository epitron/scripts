ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Curl reads and understands the following environment variables:
http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY

They should be set for protocol-specific proxies. General proxy should be set with
ALL_PROXY

A comma-separated list of host names that shouldn't go through any proxy is set in (only an asterisk, '*' matches all hosts)
NO_PROXY

If the host name matches one of these strings, or the host is within the domain of one of these strings, transactions with that node will not be proxied.

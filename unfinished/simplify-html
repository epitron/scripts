  <span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">IN THE</span>&nbsp;early fifties I suffered temporarily from a disease of middle age: I used to give philosophical talks about science—how science satisfies curiosity, how it gives you a new world view, how it gives man the ability to do things, how it gives him power—and the question is, in view of the recent development of the atomic bomb, is it a good idea to give man that much power? I also thought about the relation of science and religion, and it was about this time when I was invited to a conference in New York that was going to discuss “the ethics of equality.”</p>
  <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;text-indent:5%">There had already been a conference among the older people, somewhere on Long Island, and this year they decided to have some younger people come in and discuss the position papers they had worked out in the other conference.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;text-indent:5%">Before I got there, they sent around a list of “books you might find interesting to read, and please send us any books you want others to read, and we will store them in the library so that others may read them.”</p>
  <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;text-indent:5%">So here comes this wonderful list of books. I start down the first page: I haven’t read a single one of the books, and I feel very uneasy—I hardly belong. I look at the second page: I haven’t read a single one. I found out, after looking through the whole list, that I haven’t read<span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">any</span>&nbsp;of the books. I must be an idiot, an illiterate! There were wonderful books there, like Thomas Jefferson&nbsp;<span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">On Freedom</span>, or something like that, and there were a few&nbsp;<span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">authors</span>&nbsp;I had read. There was a book by Heisenberg, one by Schrödinger, and one by Einstein, but they were something like Einstein,&nbsp;<span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">My Later Years</span>&nbsp;and Schrödinger,&nbsp;<span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">What Is Life</span>—different from what I had read. So I had a feeling that I was out of my depth, and that I shouldn’t be&nbsp;<span style="display:inline;font-style:italic">in</span>&nbsp;this. Maybe I could just sit quietly and listen.</p>
